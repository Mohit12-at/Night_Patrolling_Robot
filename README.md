I have developed a robot security patrol that employs a night vision camera to defend any premises. The robotic vehicle is equipped with the ESP-32 CAM for night vision. It patrols along a preset route using a predefined line. The system employs the following IR-based route system to patrol the assigned field, called a line follower system. To detect an intruder, it watches the designated area by the camera mounted on a Servo Motor, which rotates 360 degrees. It searches the surroundings with its camera to identify any human faces.  When it comes in front of a face, it will run facial recognition with the ESP-32 CAM to identify between the product user or a possible intruder. It can also be outfitted with a GSM(Global System for Mobiles) module or an e-mailing service to warn the user if and when a break-in occurs.
